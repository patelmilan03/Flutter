# Project - TODO
## Introduction
created a new file under lib/todo/todo.dart that contains the model class todo.  This contains the main variables and data types of the todo functionality.
Contains the copyWith function (custom made function that works as a SaveAs feature for all the data) 


## View Viewmodel
1. Set up Viewmodel by adding the required functions for the page. the functions are add, remove and toggleDone (whether the task is done or not).used the uuid package that gives every element in the List for the tasks a unique id.
2. Set up the view by making a very barebone ui, a textfield that asks the task name and a checkbox trailing behind it, clicking it removes the task and a floating action button to add new tasks Used ListviewBuilder to append new tasks on the ui from their list counterpart in the backend.
3.
