# What is testing?
It is a way to see all the functionalities of your flutter application are working as intended or not.

Benefits of provided feature testing over manual testing:
- Repetable, automated, faster
- reliable
- scalable 
- isolated

# How to create a test?
Either install a testing package or use the preinstalled flutter_test package into the starter project.

`test` - general testing package, can run any dart project.
`flutter_test` - flutter specific framework to test flutter projects.

Both these run a script that searches for files ending with  `filename_test.dart` in the test folder at the root of Flutter Project.

Types of testing:
